1. Understand the Parameters:
    Poisson distribution has one parameter:
    λ (lambda) = average number of occurrences in a given interval.
    Example: λ = 4
2. Create a Table in Excel:
    Column A: Values of x (number of occurrences) from 0 to a reasonable upper limit (e.g., 10 or 15).
    Column B: Use the POISSON.DIST function in Excel:
      =POISSON.DIST(x, λ, FALSE)
3. Plot the Graph:
    Use a bar chart to display the distribution:
    X-axis: Number of occurrences (x)
    Y-axis: Probability P(X = x)
    Label the chart clearly with title:
    “Poisson Distribution (λ = ...)”
