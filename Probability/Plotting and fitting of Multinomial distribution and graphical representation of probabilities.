1. Define the Problem:
    Select the number of categories (e.g., 3 outcomes: A, B, C).
    Choose the number of trials n (e.g., 10).
    Assign probabilities p1, p2, p3 such that:
      p1 + p2 + p3 = 1
2. Set Up Excel Table:
    List all valid outcome combinations for the number of trials (you can use only a few combinations for simplicity).
    Example: (A=5, B=3, C=2), (A=4, B=4, C=2), etc.
    For each combination, compute the Multinomial probability:
    Formula (manual using Excel):â€‹
    In Excel, you can use:
    =FACT(n)/(FACT(x1)*FACT(x2)*FACT(x3)) * p1^x1 * p2^x2 * p3^x3
3. Plot the Graph:
    Use a bar chart to show different combinations and their probabilities.
    Alternatively, use a 3D pie chart to show the proportion of each category in one outcome.
