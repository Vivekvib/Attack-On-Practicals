1. Choose Real-life Problems (examples below):
  Heights of students in a class.
  IQ scores in a population.
  Lifespan of light bulbs.
2. Set Up Excel Table:
  For a given X, μ, and σ, use:
  =NORM.DIST(X, μ, σ, TRUE) to calculate P(X ≤ x)
  To find P(a < X < b):
    P(a<X<b)=NORM.DIST(b,μ,σ,TRUE)−NORM.DIST(a,μ,σ,TRUE)
3. Optional Z-score Column:
  Add a column to compute Z:
  =(X - μ)/σ
