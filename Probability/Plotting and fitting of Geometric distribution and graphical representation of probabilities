1. Understand the Parameters:
    p = probability of success in each trial.
    Example: p = 0.3
    x = trial number on which the first success occurs (e.g., from 1 to 10).
2. Set Up Excel Table:
    Column A: Values of x from 1 to 10 (or more).
    Column B: Use the GEOME.DIST function in Excel:
      =GEOME.DIST(x, p, FALSE)
3. Plot the Graph:
    Insert a bar chart with:
    X-axis: Trial number x
    Y-axis: Probability P(X = x)
    Label your chart properly:
    Title: “Geometric Distribution (p = …)”
    Axes: Trial number, Probability
